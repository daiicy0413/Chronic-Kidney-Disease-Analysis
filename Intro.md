# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Analysis
The dataset on chronic kidney disease used in this project was obtained from Kaggle. Through multivariate analysis, it is possible to discern which variables are closely correlated with kidney failure. This analytical approach contributes to a deeper understanding of the disease and aids individuals in predicting and then preventing its onset.
The data comprise 26 columns, 400 observations, and variable types that are numeric and character. Figure 1 provides a data description.
